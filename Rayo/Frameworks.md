## FrontEnd Technologies:

* ### React Native ⚛:
    + Multiplatform movile development framework. Powered by Meta´s React base, it counts with the same web component development base. It is an extension of React´s functionality to mobiles with pre-created components which help to interact natively with each device´s OS.

## BakcEnd tecnologies:
* ### MongoDB:
    + MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL) which is deemed non-free by several distributions.
* ### NextJS:
    + Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites. React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js".Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side.
* ### Express:
    + Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins.
