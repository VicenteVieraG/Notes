# Portfolio 2: Individualism and the Lost of Unity in Society

The premise presented in the book on which this essay is based on, basically is talking about a social and philosophical term called *individualism*. The precense of this concept in humanity´s history dates back to the industrial revolution. Before that event, it was unthinkable to even survive without the help of others. Each society node was hardly bonded with the rest of the structure. When most of the work started to get automized people could stop depending on others to do most of their activities. This continued increasing until this days.

One of the advantages of individualism is to do what you want when you want to. You can not only survive, but to live a careless life until you die. Also, because the same capitalist structure of society, this kind of thinking strand is the best to exist in a highly competitive world. This a reactionary ideology, having the capability of a swift response to basically all of the problems you and every people could ever deal with, because of a needless concensus and only thinking first on you than in others.

In other hand, the individualism spreaded in a lot of the aspects of life has became the origin of a lot of our problems as a society. A great example is the lack of social interaction. This is a highly remarkable point in today´s society, being seen in how people try to avoid dealing with other persons. A simple but yet accurate example is sending text messages instead of calling directly an other person. I´ve known a lot of people with this kind of issue. But the biggest direct problem is the depression created by this ideology. Humans are meant to interact with other people since the beginnig of our specie, is part of our escense. By being capable of perfectly living without human interactions people can easily fall into blue, ironicly, having everythig.

There is a japanese term created for people taking individualism to the edge of society; this people is called *hikikomori*. They live and die completely alone and locked in their houses. They absolutly never go out. The only reason people know they are dead is because the morbid smell comming from their department.

Utterly in matter of good or bad I can´t make any asumption on this subject. The society is always evolving and non of our past ideologies was the best or was misstakenless. This is the path progress has taken and while it might end up being an other obstacle in our way to the pinacle of the society development, the best thing we can do is to criticize and analyse this kind of thinking strands to get the best of them and improve the weak points, try to clean up the fog in our judgement to always try to get the best possible end up.
