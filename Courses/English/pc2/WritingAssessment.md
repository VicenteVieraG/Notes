When talking about where to be raised there are a lot of factors to take into consideration. One of the most importants is the money. If you have a lot of money growth can be awesome in every place. I know some people in this conditions for both cases and in both scenarios I imagine my self growing there as somethig totally awesome.

Growing in the city has the counterpart of the pollution in the air. Here in Guadalajara most of the areas get affected continously by forestal fires.

However, rising in a city as big as Guadalajara has some others avails. Everythig is closer in comparison with the distances in the rural areas, this includes things like schools, markets, farmacies and restaurants, therefore, implying a bigger gas expense.
