# Sharing-Economy Essay
During the past decades the sharing-economy phenomenon has been raising in use. Sadly, this is not just some kind of trend or a challenge but rather, a necesity. Some Universities had a tradition in wich the students needed to spend some time living within the campus recidencies, this with the idea in mind of bringing forth the patriotic spirit and belonging feeling in the new students. With the pass of time, newer generations started suffering the effects of the economic hangover. Day to day life was getting expensier than it used to be. To solve this situation the people started exersicing the shared-economy in all aspects of life. People started to *share* everything for example: sharing rent and food prices, transportation, etc… Evetually, the globalization started to surface along with the information era, starting a new arc of human history with the internet as the protagonist of the social movements.

Just like any other resource like food or water, the possesion of information was valuable back in the days of intense warfares and blooming empires. Now adays, the information is treassured as never before due to the armony of overflowing information and the velocity it can be delivered. As the information flow grew bigger, the sharing-economy was brought into a walk on part in the war, back to back with the internet. Now people can not only share expences but information, ideas, and art; create a monument foundated over the collective imagination and geniality of people.

The internet beholded the rise of some of the biggest collective efforts of sharing information economy such as GitHub, Linux, DNA analisys, the arraigning of several crimes, the regathering of people across the world etc… Notwithstanding the marvels of the internet, we are still humans after all, and as so, there are people that also saw selfish objectives within this. When the information era and economy reaches certain point, the people become nothihg but numbers, digits in a big data matrix determined by the darkest sides of the human sique. The information era interpolates into the control and survilance era.

Respect in latin comes from the word *respicere* and means *to look again* or *to look backwards*. Conversely, espectacle comming from *espectare* means *to stare detailed* or *to look closely*. A society guided by the spectacle and the loss of respect is the *society of fuss* and, therefore, culminating in the loss of privacy. This goes with side by side with the fadig free will. By attacking the most vulnerable parts of our psicology masters of puppets can guide our thoughts and opinions towards what is benneficial for them to make us believe. 

Throug all human history the way we have learned was by try and catch. The concequences of the historical mistakes can usually be reverted by time and reflection. If we err now with these situations there will not have a lot if not any opportunities to go back, the control will be such that any attemp of insurrection will be impossible. It is in our hands, the hands of all the internet users to question the implications and try to take the correct way.
