# Edenia
Edenia

I was only a little kid when the war of all wars started. I did not understand at the moment; the beginning of the end. The war lasted 3 years, one year of intense warfare, two years of the activation and creation of the Cinder weapon and one day of nuclear war. Resulting in a long-lasting nuclear fallout. The ashes of the deaths keep falling until nowadays. They burn and destroy the skin at touch. The cycle of life and death, life born from life infinitely, until it doesn’t, not any more. The Cinder weapon along a lot of technology were lost after the war.

The Cinder weapon burns and sterilizes all life in the ground in a radius of 775km. All food and plants died either because of Cinder or the nuclear winter. 

I joined the local Dresden's militia resistance since I was young. We made various interventions in nearby cities in response to the help call of people dying of hunger because of the lack of food distribution and gathering by the rich and powerful. These people without access to proper food need to consume chemical food alternatives which damage the mind and soul of the users. The only remainng of them is an empty shell.

The one thing in common with all these cities is the existence of a legendary place called Edenia, where food grows unlimited. After a lot of intelligence work, suspicions of the possible location of Edenia were found. The team Castle was chosen to find Edenia in the ruins of a nearby town on the outskirts of the old capital city Prague.

4:00 am Monday, the team gathers in two helicopters ready to part.
— Hey Romeo, better you bring enough of that ammunition this time, just in case you run short of ammo like in Leipzig.
— Don’t worry Hudson, I will bring enough for you too in case you fail your shots.
— Ok Romeo, Hudson enough talking get your asses in to the helicopters now. And, in regard to you Rook, never be separated from this. 
Dutch says staring at me while pushing my G36k rifle against my chest.
— This will be your best friend when things turn out bad out there.

5:00 am. The only light visible were the strips of light coming from the slips of the helicopter's launching zone. As the helicopter was being propulsed for the takeoff me and Romeo were in comeplete silence. The only noise was the propulsion of the ship and the shaking of our heavy MASKA-1SCh helmets. As soon as the helicopters were on the air we received a message form Dutch on our radio equipment:
— Castle, our mission is reconnaissance in Edenia. The position is under the control of the Central Powers Coallition. We need to oust all Coallition's forces in the area and meet with Emile's platoon afterwards.
— Nothing good can be brewed when a bunch of aristocrats from the Coallition try to defend a bunch of ruins.
Hudson says with uncertanty and with his characteristic angry voice.
— Cheer up big guy, this is better than spending the day at the headquarters doing nothig.
Romeo says in a confident tone.

7:00am Finally, we landed at Klecany to take advantage of the city's position at the other side of the Moldava river.
— From now on is a 6 hours walk until our objective, the University of Sciences of Prague. Let's start moving Castle!
Dutch says as we land off the helicopters.
13:00pm We arrive to the university campus. Walking in line Duthc give us the sign with his fist up to stop.
— What happened here? All Coallition forces are dead.
Romeo says worried and surprised.
— The fire is still burning, this might have happened not so long ago.
Hudson infers.
— Stay alert Castle! All this give me a very bad feeling. We need to find Emile and his platoon as soon as possible.
The wounds of the people of the Coallition where caused by bullets, but, some bodies had extrange wounds, like if they had been consumed by acid.

After scanning the area we found what was left of Emile's camp. Along it, there was a command log written by Emile himself. They went inside the building and locked the door to contain what ever it was inside. Hudson managed to set a load of explosives to blow up the door. We were going to rescue Emile.

The building was registered room by room. We found nothing but the remains of a slaughter. Apparently the Coallition was supporting a team of researchers by giving them enogh food to them and their family, after all, the Coallition controlled a vast majority of the food reserves of Central Europe. None of the researchers were found alive. The log of the researh leader was found. I hope we never had found that log. He wrote:
— After 6 months of research we noticed we were making the wrong questions. The plants have adapted to this hostile ecosystem, but there is still any reasonable answer to why. It seems to be one major organism the one spreading through the ground. Where does this thing get enogh energy?
After a year, the attemps of using this new life form to create new food have failed.
The Coallition holds up the last Cinder fully functional weapon. We will use it to try to control the spreading of “Pando“.
We found the aswer, and it is not good. We should have forgotten about this. Pando is alife and Cinder is his heart. If energy had a Cancer Pando would be it. We tried to play god not once but twice, the war and then, this. We need to find a way of holding pando under control.
This could be my last message, Pando can assimilate the tecnology and use it in his favor. This is not only a cancer of the energy but of life itself. I am the only survivor and I take total responsability for the fall of this Babel tower. We flew too high and fell so low…
